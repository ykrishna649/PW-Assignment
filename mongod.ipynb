    "Q1  What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use \n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that is designed for storing and managing unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases that organize data into tables with predefined schemas, MongoDB stores data in flexible JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a category of database management systems that provide a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in ways other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Non-relational databases can store and manage unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data and are often chosen for their scalability, flexibility, and ability to handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, non-relational databases like MongoDB offer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: NoSQL databases have flexible schemas, allowing for dynamic changes to the data structure without modifying the entire database schema. This makes it easier to accommodate evolving data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed for scalability, often providing better performance and scalability for large-scale applications. They can easily handle large volumes of data and high write loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Performance: NoSQL databases are optimized for specific use cases, allowing for high performance and low latency in data retrieval and storage operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support for Unstructured Data: NoSQL databases can store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data types, such as JSON, XML, and binary data, which may not fit well into the rigid structure of relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Data and Real-time Analytics: MongoDB is well-suited for handling large volumes of data and real-time analytics applications where fast data retrieval and processing are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile Development: MongoDB's flexible schema allows for agile development practices, where the data model can evolve rapidly in response to changing requirements without downtime or schema migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented Applications: MongoDB's document-oriented data model is ideal for applications with complex, hierarchical, or nested data structures, such as content management systems, social media platforms, and e-commerce websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, allowing it to distribute data across multiple servers to handle increased workload and provide high availability and fault tolerance."

    "Q2 State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that offers a range of features designed to handle diverse data types and support flexible and scalable applications. Here are some key features of MongoDB along with explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON).\n",
    "Each document can have a different structure, allowing for heterogeneous data types within a collection.\n",
    "This document-oriented model is ideal for representing complex, nested, or hierarchical data structures.\n",
    "Dynamic Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB has a dynamic schema, meaning that documents in the same collection do not need to have the same schema.\n",
    "Fields can be added or removed from documents without affecting other documents in the collection.\n",
    "This flexibility simplifies schema design and allows for easy evolution of data models as application requirements change over time.\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, allowing you to scale out by adding more servers to a MongoDB cluster.\n",
    "It supports sharding, which distributes data across multiple servers to improve performance and handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "MongoDB can scale both read and write operations linearly with the number of servers in the cluster.\n",
    "High Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB offers high performance for read and write operations, with support for in-memory caching and optimized storage engines.\n",
    "It uses indexes to improve query performance and supports complex queries using the MongoDB Query Language (MQL).\n",
    "MongoDB can handle high-throughput workloads and real-time analytics applications.\n",
    "Rich Query Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB provides a powerful query language called the MongoDB Query Language (MQL).\n",
    "MQL supports a wide range of query operators and expressions for querying and manipulating data.\n",
    "It allows for complex queries, aggregation operations, and geospatial queries, among other capabilities.\n",
    "High Availability:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports automatic failover and data replication to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "It uses replica sets to maintain multiple copies of data across different servers, with automatic failover in case of server failures.\n",
    "Replica sets provide data redundancy and ensure that applications remain available even in the event of hardware or network failures.\n",
    "Security:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB offers robust security features to protect data at rest and in transit.\n",
    "It supports authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and encryption for data protection.\n",
    "MongoDB provides integration with external authentication systems like LDAP and Kerberos for centralized user management and authentication.\n",
    "Aggregation Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB includes a powerful aggregation framework for performing data aggregation and analysis operations.\n",
    "The aggregation framework supports a wide range of aggregation stages and operators for grouping, filtering, sorting, and transforming data.\n",
    "It allows for complex data processing and analytics tasks directly within the database."

    "Q6  Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans The sort() method in MongoDB is used to sort the documents returned by a query based on one or more fields. It allows you to specify the field(s) to sort by and the sort order (ascending or descending). The sort() method modifies the order of documents in the result set before returning them.\n",

    "Q7 Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans In MongoDB, there are three primary methods to delete documents from a collection: delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop(). Each method serves a specific purpose and is used in different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. delete_one() Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The delete_one() method is used to delete a single document from a collection. It accepts a query object as an argument, which specifies the condition for deleting the document. If no query is specified, it deletes the first document in the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a client and connect to the database\n",
    "client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017)\n",
    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "coll = db['mycollection']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert some documents\n",
    "data = [{\"_id\": \"1001\", \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 25}, {\"_id\": \"1002\", \"name\": \"Jane\", \"age\": 30}]\n",
    "coll.insert_many(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete a single document with _id \"1001\"\n",
    "coll.delete_one({\"_id\": \"1001\"})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the remaining documents\n",
    "for doc in coll.find():\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. delete_many() Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The delete_many() method is used to delete multiple documents from a collection. It also accepts a query object as an argument, which specifies the condition for deleting the documents. If no query is specified, it deletes all documents in the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a client and connect to the database\n",
    "client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017)\n",
    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "coll = db['mycollection']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert some documents\n",
    "data = [{\"_id\": \"1001\", \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 25}, {\"_id\": \"1002\", \"name\": \"Jane\", \"age\": 30}, {\"_id\": \"1003\", \"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 35}]\n",
    "coll.insert_many(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete multiple documents with age greater than 30\n",
    "coll.delete_many({\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the remaining documents\n",
    "for doc in coll.find():\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. drop() Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The drop() method is used to delete an entire collection or database. It does not accept any arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a client and connect to the database\n",
    "client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017)\n",
