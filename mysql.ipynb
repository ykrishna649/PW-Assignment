    "Q1  What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in such a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used to store and retrieve data for various purposes, ranging from simple applications like contact lists to complex systems like enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and social media platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Query Language (SQL):\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data.\n",
    "They organize data into tables with rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column represents an attribute of the record.\n",
    "SQL databases enforce a predefined schema, which means that the structure of the data (table schema) must be defined before inserting data.\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-SQL (NoSQL) Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that provide a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in ways other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.\n",
    "They can store and manage unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are schema-less or have a flexible schema, allowing for dynamic changes to the data structure without modifying the entire database schema.\n",
    "They are often chosen for their scalability, high performance, and ability to handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are categorized into different types based on their data model, including document-based (e.g., MongoDB), key-value stores (e.g., Redis), column-family stores (e.g., Apache Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j)."

    "Q2  What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete schema objects in a database. Common DDL statements include CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explain each of these DDL statements with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE:\n",
    "\n",
    "The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "Example: Creating a new table named employees with columns for employee ID, name, and salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP:\n",
    "\n",
    "The DROP statement is used to remove existing database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "Example: Dropping the employees table\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of existing database objects, such as tables.\n",
    "Example: Adding a new column named department to the employees table\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE:\n",
    "\n",
    "The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table quickly and efficiently, but it does not delete the table's structure.\n",
    "Example: Truncating all data from the employees table\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DDL statements such as CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are essential for defining, modifying, and managing the structure of database objects in SQL databases. They allow database administrators and developers to create, modify, and delete tables, views, indexes, and constraints as needed to meet the requirements of the application."

    "Ans DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to manipulate data within database objects such as tables. DML statements are used to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from tables. Let's explain three commonly used DML statements with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT:\n",
    "\n",
    "The INSERT statement is used to add new rows of data into a table.\n",
    "Example: Inserting a new record into the employees table\n",

    "\n",
    "UPDATE:\n",
    "\n",
    "The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table.\n",
    "Example: Updating the salary of an employee in the employees table\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE employees\n",
    "SET salary = 55000.00\n",
    "WHERE employee_id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE:\n",
    "\n",
    "The DELETE statement is used to remove existing rows of data from a table.\n",
    "Example: Deleting an employee record from the employees table\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE employee_id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "The INSERT statement adds a new row with specified values into the employees table.\n",
    "The UPDATE statement modifies the salary of an employee whose employee_id is 1 in the employees table.\n",
    "The DELETE statement removes the employee record whose employee_id is 1 from the employees table.\n",
    "DML statements are essential for manipulating data within tables, allowing users to insert, update, and delete records as necessary to maintain and manage the data stored in a database."

DQL statements are primarily concerned with querying data from tables or views. The most commonly used DQL statement is SELECT. Let's explain the SELECT statement with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT:\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables or views in a database.\n",

    "Q5 Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans Primary Key and Foreign Key are both concepts in relational database management systems (RDBMS) that are used to establish and enforce relationships between tables. Let's explain each concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table.\n",
    "It must contain unique values for each row, and it cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "A table can have only one Primary Key.\n",
    "Primary Keys are often used as the basis for relationships with other tables.\n",
    "Example: In a table named students, the student_id column might be designated as the Primary Key because it uniquely identifies each student.\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link between two tables.\n",
    "It creates a relationship between the Foreign Key column in one table (the child table) and the Primary Key column in another table (the parent table).\n",
    "The Foreign Key constraint ensures referential integrity, meaning that values in the Foreign Key column must exist in the corresponding Primary Key column of the parent table or be NULL (if allowed).\n",
    "Multiple rows in the child table can refer to the same row in the parent table.\n",
    "Example: In a table named courses, the instructor_id column might be designated as a Foreign Key that references the employee_id column in the employees table, establishing a relationship between instructors and employees.\n",
    "In summary, a Primary Key uniquely identifies rows in a table, while a Foreign Key establishes relationships between tables by referencing the Primary Key column(s) of another table. These constraints ensure data integrity and enable the creation of meaningful relationships between entities in a relational database."

    "Explanation of cursor() and execute() methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "cursor() method:\n",
    "The cursor() method is used to create a cursor object that allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database.\n",
    "It returns a cursor object associated with the connection.\n",

    "Syntax: cursor.execute(sql_query, parameters)\n",
    "In the code example above:\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a cursor object mycursor using the cursor() method.\n",

    "Q6 Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans In SQL, the order of execution of clauses in an SQL query generally follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM:\n",
    "\n",
    "The FROM clause specifies the tables from which data will be retrieved.\n",
    "If the query involves multiple tables, the tables are joined based on the specified join conditions.\n",
    "WHERE:\n",
    "\n",
    "The WHERE clause filters the rows returned by the FROM clause based on specified conditions.\n",
    "Rows that do not satisfy the conditions specified in the WHERE clause are excluded from the result set.\n",
    "GROUP BY:\n",
    "\n",
    "The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows.\n",
    "It typically follows the WHERE clause and precedes the HAVING clause (if used).\n",
    "It is often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.\n",
    "HAVING:\n",
    "\n",
    "The HAVING clause filters groups of rows returned by the GROUP BY clause based on specified conditions.\n",
    "It is similar to the WHERE clause but operates on groups of rows rather than individual rows.\n",
    "SELECT:\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT clause specifies the columns that will be included in the result set.\n",
    "It follows the FROM clause and precedes the ORDER BY clause (if used).\n",
    "ORDER BY:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the rows returned by the SELECT statement.\n",
    "It follows the SELECT clause and specifies the columns by which the result set should be sorted.\n",
    "It is typically the last clause in the SQL query.\n",
    "LIMIT/OFFSET (if applicable):\n",
    "\n",
    "The LIMIT clause restricts the number of rows returned by the query.\n",
    "The OFFSET clause specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows.\n",
    "These clauses are optional and are used to limit the size of the result set or implement pagination.\n",
    "It's important to note that not all queries will use all of these clauses, and the order of clauses can vary based on the specific requirements of the query. However, this is a general guideline for the typical order of execution of clauses in an SQL query."
